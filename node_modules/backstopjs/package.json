BackstopJS will consider this your *source of truth*. (Update this whenever you want).\n\n  - **Test:** BackstopJS creates a set of *test* screenshots and compares them with your *reference* screenshots. Any unwanted/unforeseen changes show up in a nice report.\n \n\n##Getting started\n### Installation\n\n#### Global installation (recommended)\nRun this in your terminal from anywhere...\n```sh\n$ npm install -g backstopjs\n```\n#### Local installation (advanced)\n\nBefore installing locally, keep in mind that local installs do not put the `Backstop` command on your application path. _Please refer to the Local Install Usage section of the documentation._\n\nTo install locally, `cd` into your project directory then...\n```\nnpm install backstopjs\n```\n\n\n\n###Installing a development version\n```sh\n$ npm install -g garris/backstopjs#master\n```\n\n###Generating your configuration file\n\n**If you don't already have a BackstopJS config file.** The following command will create a config template file which you can modify in your root directory. **Note: this will overwrite any existing backstopjs config file.**\n\nFrom your projects's directory ...\n\n```sh\n$ backstop genConfig\n```\n\nBy default, `genConfig` will put `backstop.json` at your current working path -- *if you're not sure where this is, run `echo $(pad)`, that's your current path*. Also by default, a `backstop_data` directory will be created at this same location.\n\nThe location of the `backstop.json` file as well as all resource directories can be specified -- see [Setting the config file path](#setting-the-config-file-path-version-090) below.\n\n\n###Working with your config file\n\n####Here is the configuration that `backstop genConfig` generates...\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"backstop_prod_test\",\n  \"viewports\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"phone\",\n      \"width\": 320,\n      \"height\": 480\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"tablet_v\",\n      \"width\": 568,\n      \"height\": 1024\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"tablet_h\",\n      \"width\": 1024,\n      \"height\": 768\n    }\n  ],\n  \"scenarios\": [\n    {\n      \"label\": \"homepage\",\n      \"url\": \"https://garris.github.io/BackstopJS/\",\n      \"selectors\": [\n        \".jumbotron\",\n        \".row.firstPanel\",\n        \".firstPanel .col-sm-4:nth-of-type(2)\",\n        \".firstPanel .col-sm-4:nth-of-type(3)\",\n        \".firstPanel .col-sm-4:nth-of-type(4)\",\n        \".secondPanel\",\n        \".finalWords\",\n        \"footer\"\n      ],\n      \"hideSelectors\": [],\n      \"removeSelectors\": [],\n      \"readyEvent\": null,\n      \"delay\": 500,\n      \"misMatchThreshold\" : 0.1,\n      \"onBeforeScript\": \"onBefore.js\",\n      \"onReadyScript\": \"onReady.js\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"paths\": {\n    \"bitmaps_reference\": \"backstop_data/bitmaps_reference\",\n    \"bitmaps_test\": \"backstop_data/bitmaps_test\",\n    \"casper_scripts\": \"backstop_data/casper_scripts\",\n    \"html_report\": \"backstop_data/html_report\",\n    \"ci_report\": \"backstop_data/ci_report\"\n  },\n  \"casperFlags\": [],\n  \"engine\": \"phantomjs\",\n  \"report\": [\"browser\"],\n  \"debug\": false\n}\n```\n\n####Required config properties\n\nAs a new user setting up tests for your project, you will be primarily concerned with these properties...\n\n**`id`** ‚Äì The unique name of your config file.  It's used by BackstopJS to manage and name files. It's useful to set this property for projects with multiple configs but **it's required if you plan on sharing your reference files with teammates**.  If you're not sharing with others then you can omit this property -- BackstopJS will auto-generate one for you based on your file system.\n\n**`viewports`** ‚Äì An array of screen size objects your DOM will be tested against.  Add as many as you like -- but add at least one.\n\n**`scenarios`** ‚Äì This is where you set up your actual tests. The important sub properties are...\n\n- **`scenarios[n].label`** ‚Äì Required. Used for screenshot naming.\n- **`scenarios[n].url`** ‚Äì Required. Tells BackstopJS what endpoint/document you want to test.  This can be an absolute URL or local to your current working directory.\n- **`scenarios[n].selectors`** ‚Äì An array of CSS selector strings enabling you specify what part of your DOM you want to test.  The default value is `document`, which will attempt to capture your entire layout.\n\n\n###Creating or updating reference bitmaps\n\nFrom your project directory...\n```sh\n$ backstop reference\n```\n\nThis will create (or update) your `bitmaps_reference` directory with screen captures from the current project build.\n\n\n\n###Generating test bitmaps\n\n```sh\n$ backstop test\n```\n\nThis will create a new set of bitmaps in `bitmaps_test/<timestamp>/`\n\nOnce the test bitmaps are generated, a report comparing the most recent test bitmaps against the current reference bitmaps will run. \n\nSignificant differences will be detected and displayed in the browser report.\n\n##Using BackstopJS\n\n\n###Updating or testing just one scenario (filtering)\n\nIf you need to update references (or test) for just one app-state you can do so by invoking BackstopJS with the following argument...\n```\n$ backstop reference --filter=<scenario.label>\n```\n\n\n### Testing SPAs and AJAX content\n\nIt is very common for client-side web apps is to initially download a small chunk of bootstrapping code/content and render it to the screen as soon as it arrives at the browser. Once this has completed, various JS components often take over to progressively load more content.\n\nThe problem testing these scenarios is knowing _when_ to take the screenshot.  BackstopJS solves this problem with two config properties: `readyEvent` and `delay`.\n\n**NOTE: Advanced options also include very cool CasperJS features like waitForSelector() and waitUntilVisible() ‚Äì see [adding custom CasperJS scripts](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS#running-custom-casperjs-scripts-version-080) for more info...**\n\n####Trigger screen capture via console.log()\n\nThe `readyEvent` property enables you to trigger the screen capture by logging a predefined string to the console. For example, the following line will delay screen capture until your web app calls `console.log(\"backstopjs_ready\")`...\n\n```json\n\"readyEvent\": \"backstopjs_ready\"\n```\n\nIn the above case it would be up to you to wait for all dependencies to complete before calling logging `\"backstopjs_ready\"` string to the console.\n\n\n####Delay screen capture\n\nThe `delay` property enables you to pause screen capturing for a specified duration of time. This delay is applied after `readyEvent` (if also applied).\n\n```js\n\"delay\": 1000 //delay in ms\n```\n\nIn the above case, BackstopJS would wait for one second before taking a screenshot.\n\nIn the following case, BackstopJS would wait for one second after the string `backstopjs_ready` is logged to the console.\n\n```js\n{\n  ...\n  \"readyEvent\": \"backstopjs_ready\",\n  \"delay\": 1000 //delay in ms\n}\n```\n\n\n### Dealing with dynamic content\n\nFor obvious reasons, this screenshot approach is not optimal for testing live dynamic content. The best way to test a dynamic app would be to use a known static content data stub ‚Äì or ideally many content stubs of varying lengths which, regardless of input length, should produce certain specific bitmap output.\n\n#### Hiding selectors\n\nThat said, for a use case where you are testing a DOM with say an ad banner or a block of dynamic content which retains static dimensions, we have the `hideSelectors` property in `capture/config.json` which will set the corresponding DOM to `visibility:hidden`, thus hiding the content from our Resemble.js analysis but retaining the original layout flow.\n\n```json\n  \"hideSelectors\": [\n\t\"#someFixedSizeDomSelector\"\n]\n```\n\n#### Removing selectors\nThere may also be elements which need to be completely removed during testing. For that we have `removeSelectors` which sets elements to `display:none`.\n\n```json\n\"removeSelectors\": [\n    \"#someUnpredictableSizedDomSelector\"\n]\n```\n\n### Changing test sensitivity\n`\"misMatchThreshold\"` (percentage 0.00%-100.00%) will change the amount of difference BackstopJS will tolerate before marking a test screenshot as \"failed\".  The default setting is `0.1`, this may need to be adjusted based on the kinds of testing you're doing.  \n\nMore info on how misMatchThreshold is derrived can be found here... https://github.com/Huddle/Resemble.js/blob/af57cb2f4edfbe718d24b350b2be1d956b764298/resemble.js#L495\n\n\n### Capturing the entire document\nBackstopJS recognizes a magic selector called `document`.  Use it to capture your entire HTML document (regardless of the height specified in your `viewports` object).\n\n```js\n  \"scenarios\": [\n    {\n      \"selectors\": [\n        \"document\",\n        ...\n      ],\n       ...\n    }\n```\n_Note: This is required if you want to test an entire document layout with a `height: 100%` rule specified on the `<body>` element._\n\n\n\n### Testing across different environments\nComparing against different environments is easy. (e.g. compare a production environment against a staging environment).\n\nTo do this, add a `referenceUrl` to your scenario configuration. When running `$ backstop test` BackstopJS will use the `url` for screen grabs.  When running `$ backstop reference` BackstopJS will check for `referenceUrl` and use that if it's there. Otherwise it will use `url` for both.\n\n```js\n  \"scenarios\": [\n    {\n      \"label\": \"cat meme feed sanity check\",\n      \"url\": \"http://www.moreCatMemes.com\",\n      \"referenceUrl\": \"http://staging.moreCatMemes.com:81\",\n       ...\n    }\n```\n\n\n### Running custom CasperJS scripts\n\nSimulate user actions (click, scroll, hover, wait, etc.) or states (cookie values) by running your own Casper.js script on ready. For each scenario, the custom .js file you specify is imported and run when the BackstopJS ready event is fired.\n\nFrom your project root, place your scripts in...\n\n```sh\n./backstop_data/casper_scripts\n```\n\nat the root of your config or in your scenario...\n\n```js\n\"onReadyScript\": \"filename.js\"   // Runs after onReady event on all scenarios -- use for simulating interactions (.js suffix is optional)\n\"onBeforeScript\": \"filename.js\"  // Runs before each scenario -- use for setting cookies or other env state (.js suffix is optional)\n\"scenarios\": [\n    {\n      \"label\": \"cat meme feed sanity check\",\n      \"onReadyScript\": \"filename.js\"   //  If found will run instead of onReadyScript set at the root (.js suffix is optional)\n      \"onBeforeScript\": \"filename.js\" // If found will run instead of onBeforeScript at the root (.js suffix is optional)\n       ...\n    }\n```\n\n\nInside `filename.js`, structure it like this:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = function(casper, scenario, vp) {\n  // scenario is the current scenario object being run from your backstop config\n  // vp is the current viewport object being run from your backstop config\n\n  // Example: setting cookies\n  casper.echo(\"Setting cookies\");\n  casper.then(function(){\n    casper.page.addCookie({some: 'cookie'});\n  });\n  // `casper.thenOpen()` demonstrates a redirect to the original page with your new cookie value.\n  // this step is not required if used with _onBeforeScript_\n  casper.thenOpen(scenario.url);\n\n  // Example: Adding script delays to allow for things like CSS transitions to complete.\n  casper.echo( 'Clicking button' );\n  casper.click( '.toggle' );\n  casper.wait( 250 );\n\n  // Example: changing behavior based on config values\n  if (vp.name === 'phone') {\n    casper.echo( 'doing stuff for just phone viewport here' );\n  }\n\n  // ...do other cool stuff here, see Casperjs.org for a full API and many ideas.\n}\n```\n\n#### Setting the base path for custom CasperJS scripts\n\nBy default the base path is a folder called `scripts` inside your BackstopJS installation directory. You can override this by setting the `paths.scripts` property in your `backstop.json` file to point to somewhere in your project directory (recommended).\n\n_**NOTE:** SlimerJS currently requires an absolute path -- so be sure to include the full path when using the `\"engine\": \"slimer\"` configuration option._\n\n```json\n  \"paths\": {\n    \"casper_scripts\": \"backstop_data/scripts\"\n  }\n```\n\n\n### Reporting workflow tips\n\nOne testing approach to consider is incorporating BackstopJS into your build process and just let the CLI report run on each build.  It's natural for your layout to break while you're in feature development -- refer back to the report when you feel things should be shaping up. Check the in-browser version of the report occasionally as needed when you need deeper information about what's happening in a test case.\n\n_CLI Report_\n\n![](homepage/img/CLI_report.png)\n\n\n_Browser Report_\n\n![](homepage/img/browserReport.png)\n\n\nUsing the report property in `backstop.json` enable or disable browser including/excluding the respective properties. E.G. The following settings will run both reports at the same time.\n\n```json\n\"report\": [\"browser\", \"CI\"]\n```\n\nIf you choose the CI-only reporting you can always enter the following command to see the latest test run report in the browser.\n\n```sh\n$ backstop openReport\n```\n\n#### Test report integration with a build system like Jenkins/Travis\n\nThe following config would enable the CI - report (*default: junit format*)\n\n```json\n\"report\" : [ \"CI\" ],\n```\n\nThe regression test report will be generated in the JUnit format and the report will be placed in the given directory (*default: [backstopjs dir]/test/ci_report/xunit.xml*).\n\nYou may customize the testsuite name and/or a report file (xunit.xml) path to your build report directory by using the below configuration overrides,\n\n```js\n\"paths\": {\n       \"ci_report\" :  \"backstop_data/ci_report\"\n},\n\"ci\": {\n      \"format\" :  \"junit\" ,\n      \"testReportFileName\": \"myproject-xunit\", // in case if you want to override the default filename (xunit.xml)\n      \"testSuiteName\" :  \"backstopJS\"\n},\n```\n\n####CLI error handling\n\nWhen a layout error is found in CLI mode, BackstopJS will let you know in a general report displayed in the console. In addition, BackstopJS will throw an error that will be passed to calling process.\n\n###Using a js based config file\n\nJSON-based configs cramping your style? Well, here's some good news -- BackstopJS allows you to import all config parameters as a node module (as an option instead of JSON) which allows you to use comments, variables and logic etc. inside of your config.\n\nTo use a js module based config file, explicitly specify your config filepath when running a command. e.g.\n\n```sh\n$ backstop test --configPath=backstopTests/someTest.js\n```\n_See the next section for more info on setting the config file path._\n\nBe sure to export your config object as a node module. \n\n\n\n###Setting the config file path\nOften, users have multiple config files to test various different scenarios or even different projects. By default, BackstopJS looks for `backstop.json` in your project's root directory (in parallel with your `node_modules` directory). You can override this by passing a `--configPath` argument when running any command. e.g.\n\n```sh\n# example 1: run reference generation with absolute path\n$ backstop reference --configPath=~/backstopTests/someTest.json\n# Will capture reference files using scenarios from someTest.json inside backstopTests inside your home folder.\n\n# example 2: run test with absolute path\n$ backstop test --configPath=~/backstopTests/someTest.json\n# Will run tests using scenarios from `someTest.json` inside `backstopTests` inside your home folder.\n\n# example 3: run test with relative path\n$ backstop test --configPath=backstopTests/someTest.json\n# Will run tests using scenarios from `someTest.json` inside `backstopTests` inside your project root folder.\n\n# example 4: run test with relative path and JS module\n$ backstop test --configPath=backstopTests/someTest.js\n# You can also specify your config parameters as a node module. This will import `someTest.js` from `backstopTests` inside your project root folder.\n```\n\nNOTES:\n- all paths are relative to the location of the BackstopJS install directory _(which is either inside your project's `node_modules` or `bower_components` depending on how BackstopJS was installed)._\n- _Remember to add that extra `--` after the `backstop test` and `backstop reference` commands._\n\n###Setting the bitmap and script directory paths \nBy default, BackstopJS saves generated resources into the `backstop_data` directory in parallel with your `backstop.json` config file. The location of the various resource types are configurable so they can easily be moved inside or outside your source control or file sharing environment. See below for the options...\n\n_Please note: these file paths are relative to your current working directory $(pwd)._\n\n```json\n  ...\n  \"paths\": {\n    \"bitmaps_reference\": \"backstop_data/bitmaps_reference\",\n    \"bitmaps_test\": \"backstop_data/bitmaps_test\",\n    \"casper_scripts\": \"backstop_data/casper_scripts\",\n    \"html_report\": \"backstop_data/html_report\",\n    \"ci_report\": \"backstop_data/ci_report\"\n  }\n```\n\n###Changing the rendering engine\nBackstopJS supports using PhantomJS or SlimerJS for web app rendering. (With thanks to CasperJS for doing the heavy lifting here.)\n\nFirst, be sure to have SlimerJS installed. From your root directory run...\n\n```sh\n$ sudo npm install -g slimerjs\n```\n\nThen, in your `backstop.json` config file, update the engine property to...\n\n```json\n  \"engine\": \"slimerjs\"\n```\nThats it.\n\n<!--\n###Changing the reporting server port\n\nThe default port used by BackstopJS is 3001.   You can change it by setting the `port` parameter in the `backstop.json` file.\n-->\n\n###Setting Casper command-line flags\nThis is for you if for some reason you find yourself needing advanced configuration access to CasperJS.  You can set CasperJS flags via `casperFlags` like so...\n\n```json\n\"casperFlags\": [\n  \"--engine=slimerjs\",\n  \"--proxy-type=http\",\n  \"--proxy=proxyIp:port\",\n  \"--proxy-auth=user:pass\"\n]\n```\n\n###Installing BackstopJS Locally\nThe main reason to install backstop locally is likely to be a managed integration with a build implementation.\n\nFrom the...\n```\n<your-project-path>/node_modules/backstopjs/\n```\n...directory you can run...\n```\n$ npm run reference\n$ npm run test\n$ npm run genConfig\n$ npm run openReport\n```\nWhich maps to the respective `backstop <command>`.\n\nAlternatively, when BackstopJS is installed locally, NPM will recognize the `backstop <command>` pattern originating from your own NPM `package.json` scripts. The following would enable you to run the\n```\nscripts: {\n  reference: backstop reference\n  test: backstop test\n  genConfig: backstop genConfig\n}\n``` \n\nThe above is a crude example -- there are other fancy mappings you can create as well -- check out the NPM documentation for more info.\n\n\n##Troubleshooting\n\n###Migrating to 2.0\n\n_Filename issue: Projects don't work when I share with other users or run in different environments._\n\n####If you just upgraded to 2.x from 1.x \n\nFilename formats have changed.  To use the 1.x (compatible) file format, use the `fileNameTemplate` property like so...\n\n```\n{\n...\nfileNameTemplate: '{scenarioIndex}_{scenarioLabel}_{selectorIndex}_{selectorLabel}_{viewportIndex}_{viewportLabel}',\n...\n```\n\n####If you are not migrating scripts but have recently upgraded BackstopJS\n\nBe sure to use a config `id` in your config file. See https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS/issues/291\n\n###Windows users...\n\nPhantomJS needs Python -- please make sure you have Python installed...\n_see https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS/issues/185_\n\n\n###The dreaded _command-not-found_ error...\n\nDid you install BackstopJS with the global option?  If installing globally remember to add that `-g` when installing with npm *i.e.* `npm install backstop -g`.     If you installed *locally*, remember that the `backstop <command>` pattern will only be available to your npm scripts -- see the local installation section above for more info.\n\n\n###Debugging\n\nTo enable verbose console output when running your tests set the `debug` property to `true` in `backstop.json`.  This will also output your  payload to the terminal so you can make sure to check that the server is sending what you expect. üòâ\n\n```json\n  \"debug\": true\n```\n\n\n---\n##Tutorials, Extensions and more\n\n- BackstopJS tutorial on [css-tricks.com](http://css-tricks.com/automating-css-regression-testing/)\n\n-  A lovely article on [Making Visual Regression Useful](https://medium.com/@philgourley/making-visual-regression-useful-acfae27e5031#.y3mw9tnxt) by [Phillip Gourley](https://medium.com/@philgourley?source=post_header_lockup)\n\n- Automated regression testing for AngularJS (and other) web-apps -- article on [DWB](http://davidwalsh.name/visual-regression-testing-angular-applications)\n\n- Want to add BackstopJS to your existing *gulp* build?

Other implementations of Resemble.js, namely [PhantomCSS](https://github.com/Huddle/PhantomCSS) require writing long form [CasperJS](http://casperjs.org) tests -- which is of course great for testing complex UI interactions ‚Äì- but kind of cumbersome for testing simple applications like static CMS templates, lots and lots of app states and different screen sizes.\n\nBackstopJS may be just the thing if you develop custom WordPress, Drupal or other CMS templates.  Tested on OSX.\n\nBackstopJS was created by [Garris Shipon](expanded.me) during the [Art.com labs](www.art.com) years.\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/garris\" class=\"twitter-follow-button\" data-show-count=\"false\">Follow @garris</a></strong>\n<script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');</script>\n\n\n---\n\n##Gratitude\nMany many thanks to [all the contributors](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS/graphs/contributors) with special thanks to...\n- [Suresh Kumar.
